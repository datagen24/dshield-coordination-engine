We take security vulnerabilities seriously. If you discover a security vulnerability in the DShield Coordination Engine, please follow these steps:

### 1. **DO NOT** create a public GitHub issue
Security vulnerabilities should be reported privately to avoid potential exploitation.

### 2. Email Security Team
Send an email to: **dshield_projects@scpeterson.com**

Include the following information:
- **Type of issue**: Buffer overflow, SQL injection, XSS, etc.
- **Full paths of source file(s)**: Related to the vulnerability
- **The number of line(s)**: Where the vulnerability exists
- **Any special configuration**: Required to reproduce the issue
- **Step-by-step instructions**: To reproduce the issue
- **Proof-of-concept or exploit code**: If available
- **Impact of the issue**: Including potential attack scenarios

### 3. Response Timeline
- **Initial Response**: Within 48 hours
- **Status Update**: Within 7 days
- **Resolution**: Depends on severity and complexity

### 4. Vulnerability Severity Levels

| Level | Description | Response Time |
|-------|-------------|---------------|
| **Critical** | Remote code execution, authentication bypass | 24 hours |
| **High** | Data exposure, privilege escalation | 48 hours |
| **Medium** | Information disclosure, DoS | 7 days |
| **Low** | Minor issues, best practice violations | 14 days |

## Security Measures

- All code undergoes security review before merge
- Automated security scanning with Bandit, Safety, and Semgrep
- Container security scanning with Trivy
- Regular dependency vulnerability assessments

### Infrastructure Security
- Non-root container execution
- Minimal base images
- Encrypted secrets management via 1Password CLI
- Network isolation between services
- TLS encryption for all communications

### API Security
- JWT-based authentication
- API key validation
- Input sanitization and validation
- Rate limiting and throttling
- CORS policy enforcement

### Data Security
- Encrypted data at rest
- Secure data transmission
- Audit logging for all operations
- Configurable data retention policies

## Responsible Disclosure

We follow responsible disclosure practices:
1. **Private reporting** of vulnerabilities
2. **Timely acknowledgment** of valid reports
3. **Collaborative resolution** with reporters
4. **Public disclosure** after fixes are deployed
5. **Credit acknowledgment** for security researchers

## Security Updates

- **Critical/High**: Immediate patches and releases
- **Medium**: Scheduled releases within 30 days
- **Low**: Next regular release cycle

## Security Contact

- **Email**: security@dshield.org
- **PGP Key**: [Available upon request]
- **Response Time**: 24-48 hours for initial response

## Bug Bounty

We appreciate security researchers who help improve our security posture. While we don't currently offer a formal bug bounty program, we do acknowledge and credit security researchers in our release notes and security advisories.

## Compliance

The DShield Coordination Engine is designed with security compliance in mind:
- **SOC 2 Type II** readiness
- **GDPR** data protection compliance
- **CCPA** privacy compliance
- **Academic research** standards compliance
- **CIS** Center for internet security critical security controls
Note that while designed with compliance in mind, we do not ensure that we meet any of the requirements, use at your own risk.
