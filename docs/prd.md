# DShield Coordination Engine - Product Requirements Document

## Document Information
- **Version**: 1.0
- **Date**: July 28, 2025
- **Project**: DShield Coordination Engine
- **Repository**: TBD (new repository)
- **Related Issue**: [dsheild-mcp#80](https://github.com/datagen24/dsheild-mcp/issues/80)

## Executive Summary

The DShield Coordination Engine is a server-side service designed to analyze attack patterns from honeypot data and distinguish between coordinated campaigns and coincidental timing. This addresses critical academic and operational needs for evidence-based attribution in cybersecurity research.

## Problem Statement

### Current Limitations
- Rule-based correlation struggles with coordinated vs coincidental attack detection
- Academic reviewers require evidence-based coordination assessment
- Individual analyst workstations lack resources for complex pattern analysis
- No standardized methodology for coordination confidence scoring

### Business Impact
- **Academic Credibility**: Research publications require defensible coordination claims
- **Operational Efficiency**: Analysts need automated pattern recognition for large datasets
- **Resource Optimization**: Heavy ML workloads belong on dedicated server infrastructure
- **Team Collaboration**: Shared analysis results improve collective threat understanding

## Product Vision

**"Enable cybersecurity researchers and analysts to definitively distinguish coordinated attack campaigns from coincidental activity through AI-powered pattern analysis with quantified confidence scores."**

## User Stories

### Primary Users: Security Researchers
```
As a security researcher,
I want to analyze honeypot attack data for coordination patterns,
So that I can make evidence-based claims about campaign attribution in academic publications.

Acceptance Criteria:
- System provides coordination confidence score (0-1) with statistical basis
- Analysis includes behavioral clustering, temporal correlation, and infrastructure relationships
- Results are reproducible and auditable for peer review
- Processing time under 5 minutes for typical dataset (100-1000 attack sessions)
```

### Primary Users: Security Analysts
```
As a security analyst,
I want to query coordination analysis via API from my local tools,
So that I can quickly assess whether multiple attacks represent a coordinated campaign.

Acceptance Criteria:
- RESTful API integration with existing dshield-mcp workflow
- Results include actionable intelligence for incident response
- Analysis scales to real-time honeypot data streams
- Clear visualization of coordination evidence
```

### Secondary Users: Security Operations Centers
```
As a SOC manager,
I want to monitor coordination detection metrics across our infrastructure,
So that I can track campaign activity and resource allocation needs.

Acceptance Criteria:
- Dashboard showing coordination trends over time
- Alert thresholds for high-confidence coordinated campaigns
- Resource utilization monitoring for analysis capacity planning
- Integration with existing SIEM workflows
```
