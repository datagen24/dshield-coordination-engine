"""Health check endpoints.

This module provides health monitoring and readiness check endpoints for the
DShield Coordination Engine API. These endpoints are used by load balancers,
container orchestration systems, and monitoring tools to verify service health.

The health endpoints include:
- Basic health check for service availability
- Readiness check for Kubernetes deployments
- Liveness check for container health monitoring

Basic health check endpoint for service availability.

This endpoint performs a simple health check to verify that the service
is running and responsive. It does not check external dependencies and
is suitable for load balancer health checks.

**Use Cases**:
- Load balancer health checks
- Basic service monitoring
- Container health verification
- Simple availability testing

**Response Codes**:
- `200 OK`: Service is healthy and responsive
- `503 Service Unavailable`: Service is unhealthy or unresponsive

**Monitoring Integration**:
This endpoint can be used with monitoring systems like:
- Prometheus health checks
- Kubernetes liveness probes
- AWS ALB/NLB health checks
- Docker health checks
